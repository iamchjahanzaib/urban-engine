1.Is this good?
No, relying only on accepting the terms of service is not sufficient for GDPR compliance. While accepting the terms of service is important, it does not cover consent for processing personal data. GDPR requires organizations to obtain explicit consent for collecting and processing personal information, especially when it comes to data used for purposes beyond what is strictly necessary for the service, such as marketing or sharing with third parties. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Systems should also allow users to withdraw consent easily. Relying solely on the acceptance of terms of service overlooks these key requirements, meaning users might unknowingly agree to broader data practices than intended, thus risking non-compliance with GDPR.
2.Example of required consent:
An example page where consent is required would be the registration page in a booking system. This page collects personal details like name, email, and potentially other sensitive information. According to GDPR, organizations must obtain explicit, informed consent from users before collecting or processing such data. The registration page should include a checkbox or similar mechanism where users actively grant consent for their data to be processed, with a clear reference to the privacy policy, which informs them how their data will be used. Without this consent, the registration process should not proceed.
